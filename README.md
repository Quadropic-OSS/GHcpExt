# GitHub Copilot Authentication Tool

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning & Disclaimer**

Use of this tool is at your own risk and discretion. The code is inspired by [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode/blob/dev/packages/opencode/src/auth/github-copilot.ts). If you are not satisfied with the official GitHub Copilot UX or agent, this method demonstrates how to use the model with other UIs or tools or agents. **Do not use this for any production, legal, or intellectual property-sensitive applications.** The client app does not perform any additional actions beyond authentication. We take no responsibility for any misuse or consequences arising from the use of this code.

A simple tool to authenticate with GitHub and retrieve a Copilot API token using the OAuth Device Flow. This project provides both Python and Node.js implementations for maximum flexibility.

## üîç Overview

This tool implements GitHub's OAuth Device Flow to authenticate users and obtain a GitHub Copilot API token. The device flow is particularly useful for CLI applications and headless environments where traditional web-based OAuth flows are not suitable.

The authentication process involves:
1. Requesting a device code from GitHub
2. Prompting the user to visit GitHub and enter the device code
3. Polling GitHub for an access token
4. Using the access token to retrieve a Copilot API token

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Implementation**: Available in both Python and Node.js
- **OAuth Device Flow**: Secure authentication without requiring a web server
- **User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and timeout management
- **GitHub Copilot Integration**: Direct integration with GitHub Copilot's internal API

## üìã Prerequisites

### For Python Version
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `requests` library

### For Node.js Version
- Node.js 12.0 or higher
- `axios` library

## üöÄ Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ghcopilot-test
```

### Python Setup
```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install requests
```

### Node.js Setup
```bash
# Install required Node.js packages
npm install
```

## üìñ Usage

### Python Version

Run the Python script:
```bash
python ghcopilotauth.py
```

### Node.js Version

Run the Node.js script:
```bash
node ghcopilotauth.js
```

### Expected Output

Both versions will provide similar output:

```
Requesting device code from GitHub...

üëâ Visit https://github.com/login/device and enter code: XXXX-XXXX

Waiting for user to authorize...
Retrieving Copilot API token...

‚úÖ GitHub Copilot API Key:
gho_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Authentication Steps

1. **Run the Script**: Execute either the Python or Node.js version
2. **Visit GitHub**: Open the provided URL in your browser
3. **Enter Code**: Input the displayed device code
4. **Authorize**: Grant the requested permissions
5. **Wait**: The script will automatically detect authorization and retrieve your token

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Device Code Request
The script requests a device code from GitHub's OAuth device endpoint:
- **Endpoint**: `https://github.com/login/device/code`
- **Client ID**: `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98` (GitHub Copilot's official client ID)
- **Scope**: `read:user` (minimal permissions required)

### 2. User Authorization
GitHub returns:
- `device_code`: Used for polling
- `user_code`: User enters this on GitHub
- `verification_uri`: Where user goes to authorize
- `expires_in`: How long the codes are valid
- `interval`: How often to poll for results

### 3. Token Polling
The script polls GitHub's access token endpoint until:
- User authorizes (returns access token)
- User denies (returns error)
- Request times out

### 4. Copilot Token Retrieval
Using the access token, the script requests a Copilot-specific token from:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token`
- **Headers**: Includes editor version information for compatibility

## üåê API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Method |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `https://github.com/login/device/code` | Request device code | POST |
| `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` | Exchange device code for access token | POST |
| `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token` | Get Copilot API token | GET |

## üîí Security Considerations

### Important Notes

- **Client ID**: Uses GitHub Copilot's official client ID (`Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`)
- **Token Storage**: Tokens are only printed to console - implement secure storage for production use
- **Scope Limitation**: Only requests `read:user` permissions
- **HTTPS Only**: All API calls use HTTPS for secure communication

### Best Practices

1. **Secure Storage**: Never store tokens in plain text files
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. **Token Rotation**: Implement token refresh mechanisms for long-lived applications
4. **Access Control**: Limit who can access and execute these scripts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Authorization timed out"
- **Cause**: User didn't authorize within the timeout period (usually 15 minutes)
- **Solution**: Run the script again and authorize promptly

#### "Authorization failed"
- **Cause**: User denied the authorization request
- **Solution**: Run the script again and approve the authorization

#### Network Errors
- **Cause**: Network connectivity issues or GitHub API unavailability
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and try again

#### Python: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'"
- **Cause**: Missing required Python package
- **Solution**: Install with `pip install requests`

#### Node.js: "Cannot find module 'axios'"
- **Cause**: Missing required Node.js package
- **Solution**: Install with `npm install axios`

### Debug Mode

For additional debugging, you can modify the scripts to include more verbose logging:

**Python**: Add `import logging; logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`
**Node.js**: Set environment variable `DEBUG=axios` before running
